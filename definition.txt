Time series data: sequence of value that change over time.

Step Response: The step response of a system is the reaction of the system to a sudden change in input, typically represented as a step function.
It is used to analyze the dynamic behavior of a system and to identify its stability, settling time, and overshoot.
In control systems, step response is used to design controllers that can achieve desired performance in terms of stability, speed of response, and steady-state error.
The step response can be represented by a graph that shows how the output of the system changes over time in response to a step input.
